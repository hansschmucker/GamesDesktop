GamesDesktop
============

A launcher/downloader/manager for games from GOG.com and other services.

In order to get this to run you need a recent XULRunner version from
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/xulrunner/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/

Put the XULRunner directory (not its content) from that archive into your
repository. Don't worry, it will not be synced. Take the xulrunner-stub.exe
and copy it into your repository directory. Rename it to GamesDesktop.exe
to keep it from getting synced.

For now, the code is Windows-only, although there are discussions about
a cross-platform toolbox.

All discussion happens (for now) over at this thread at the GOG forums:
